### Can WebGPU be used for native mobile or desktop apps?
Yes. You can write C++ or Rust code to create native applications with WebGPU.
However support for some browsers and specially mobile browsers is Work In Progress at the moment.

### How much easier would it be to start with the framework like Babylon.js instead of trying to understand the WebGPU ?
It's not that different at the moment. And I highly recommend learning WebGPU itself.
